# Shyam Development Project

## Overview
A Python development project set up to run in the Replit environment. This is a basic interactive console application that demonstrates fundamental Python functionality.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **Main File**: `main.py` - Interactive console application
- **Dependencies**: Standard library only (see `requirements.txt`)
- **Project Type**: Console application

## Recent Changes
- **2025-09-07**: Initial project setup in Replit environment
  - Installed Python 3.12 module
  - Created basic interactive console application
  - Set up Replit workflow for Python execution
  - Configured project structure with main.py and requirements.txt

## User Preferences
- Python-based development
- Interactive console applications
- Clean, simple project structure

## Features
- Interactive user input handling
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Welcome message and user interaction

## Running the Project
The project is configured with a Replit workflow that automatically runs `python main.py`. The application will:
1. Display a welcome message
2. Ask for user name input
3. Perform a simple calculation with two numbers
4. Handle basic error cases

## Development Notes
- Uses Python 3.12 with standard library
- Console-based interaction
- Ready for extension with additional features
- Follows Python best practices with proper error handling
